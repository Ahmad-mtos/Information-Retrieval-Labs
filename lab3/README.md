# Lab 3

## Overview

This Notebook has two main sections. The first section involves assessing the organic results of search engines given the same query, "How to get from Kazan to Voronezh", using the guidelines outlined in chapters 13.0-13.4 of [this document](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf). The second section involves engineering a bucket of URLs relevant to the query "free cloud git", automating the search procedure using a tool such as https://serpapi.com/ or https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview, and computing MRR@10 and Precision@10.
