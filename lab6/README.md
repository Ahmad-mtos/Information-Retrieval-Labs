# Lab 6

## Overview

This Notebook provides an introduction to building recommender systems and searching for similar items using vector representations of different objects. The notebook demonstrates the process of creating a recommender system based on the vector-space model, dimensionality reduction, and cosine similarity measure. The dataset used for this demonstration is based on the nutrition of different food items.

## Dependencies

The notebook requires the following packages or libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- math
- matplotlib
- mpl_toolkits
- sklearn
- os
- IPython

## Contents

The notebook contains the following sections:

1. Reading the dataset
2. Assigning colors to each food item
3. Plotting functions
4. Data visualization
5. Dimensionality reduction with Principal Components Analysis
6. Dimensionality reduction with SVD
7. Norming
8. Recommendations

## Results

The main results of the notebook:

- Building a recommender system that is based on the vector-space model, dimensionality reduction, and cosine similarity measure.
- Visualizing the nutrition data in 2D and 3D.
- Reducing the dimensions of the nutrition data to 3 principal components using PCA and SVD.
- Norming the dataset vector-wise (row-wise).
- Returning the k closest food items to the provided query vector.

## Usage

To use the notebook, you will need to have the required dependencies installed. Once you have installed the required dependencies, you can run the notebook and follow the instructions provided in each section.
